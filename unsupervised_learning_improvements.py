# How AI Improves Through Unsupervised Learning

"""
Unsupervised learning allows AI systems to discover patterns and structures 
in data without labeled examples. Here are the key ways AI improves through
unsupervised learning:
"""

# 1. Pattern Discovery and Clustering
def clustering_benefits():
    """
    - Discovers natural groupings in data (customer segments, document topics)
    - Identifies anomalies and outliers
    - Reduces human labeling effort
    """
    improvements = [
        "K-means for customer segmentation",
        "DBSCAN for anomaly detection", 
        "Hierarchical clustering for taxonomy discovery"
    ]
    return improvements

# 2. Dimensionality Reduction
def dimensionality_reduction():
    """
    - Compresses high-dimensional data while preserving structure
    - Enables visualization of complex datasets
    - Improves computational efficiency
    """
    techniques = {
        "PCA": "Linear dimensionality reduction",
        "t-SNE": "Non-linear visualization",
        "Autoencoders": "Neural network-based compression"
    }
    return techniques

# 3. Representation Learning
def representation_learning():
    """
    - Learns meaningful features automatically
    - Creates embeddings that capture semantic relationships
    - Transfers knowledge to downstream tasks
    """
    examples = [
        "Word2Vec/GloVe for word embeddings",
        "BERT/GPT pre-training on unlabeled text",
        "Contrastive learning (SimCLR) for vision"
    ]
    return examples

# 4. Generative Modeling
def generative_models():
    """
    - Learns to generate new, realistic data samples
    - Understands underlying data distribution
    - Enables data augmentation and synthesis
    """
    models = {
        "VAEs": "Variational Autoencoders for controlled generation",
        "GANs": "Generative Adversarial Networks for realistic synthesis",
        "Diffusion": "Diffusion models for high-quality generation"
    }
    return models

# 5. Self-Supervised Learning
def self_supervised_learning():
    """
    - Creates supervised tasks from unlabeled data
    - Learns robust representations without manual labels
    - Achieves near-supervised performance
    """
    approaches = [
        "Masked language modeling (BERT)",
        "Image rotation prediction",
        "Contrastive predictive coding"
    ]
    return approaches
